# Peter Baker Portfolio Project


This is my First Milestone project for the CodeInstitute. The aim is to create a personal portfolio using the skills i have learnt up to this point. The website will showcase the developers skills and creativity.

The deployed site can be seen here.


## UX
 
This a beginner full stack developer website. The aim of the site is to promote the developer for future employment and potential projects.

This is a fully responsive website. Which can be used on many platforms and browsers.

### The target audience for the website.
- Potential Employers
- Users looking for help with websites
- Other developers looking for help with current projects

### As a Visitor

- To easily understand what the page is about.
- To straight away visually see what the developer is capable of.
- To be able to navigate my way through the website and easily return to previously visited pages without using the back key.
- To be able to see and download the developers CV without leaving the site.
- To be able to view the developers projects to date.
- To be able to contact the developer and give as much information as needed.

The Website will consist of 4 pages and a link to the developers CV.
