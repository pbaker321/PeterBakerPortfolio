# Peter Baker Portfolio Project


This is my First Milestone project for the CodeInstitute. The aim is to create a personal portfolio using the skills i have learnt up to this point. The website will showcase the developers skills and creativity.

The deployed site can be seen here.


## UX
 
This a beginner full stack developer website. The aim of the site is to promote the developer for future employment and potential projects.

This is a fully responsive website. Which can be used on many platforms and browsers.

### The target audience for the website.
- Potential Employers
- Users looking for help with websites
- Other developers looking for help with current projects

### As a Visitor

- To easily understand what the page is about.
- To straight away visually see what the developer is capable of.
- To be able to navigate my way through the website and easily return to previously visited pages without using the back key.
- To be able to see and download the developers CV without leaving the site.
- To be able to view the developers projects to date.
- To be able to contact the developer and give as much information as needed.

The Website will consist of 4 pages and a link to the developers CV.

The wireframes can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/SYpJ97bFEnBfiS0DF3i0Rj/Portfolio)


## Features

4 pages consisting of:
- Home/Landing page. Striking landing page to gain the users attention.
- About. Information about the developer. Developers skills link to CV.
- Portfolio. A summary about previous projects.  
- Contact. A form to contact the developer for future projects or employment.

### Existing Features:
- Navigation Bar. Easily navigate to pages. Page is marked as active.
- Footer. Links to social media.
- Portfolio Page. Links to both the deployed site and to the repository
- Contact Form.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
