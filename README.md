# Peter Baker Portfolio Project


This is my First Milestone project for the CodeInstitute. The aim is to create a personal portfolio using the skills i have learnt up to this point. The website will showcase the developers skills and creativity.

The deployed site can be seen here.


## UX
 
This a beginner full stack developer website. The aim of the site is to promote the developer for future employment and potential projects.

This is a fully responsive website. Which can be used on many platforms and browsers.

### The target audience for the website.
- Potential Employers
- Users looking for help with websites
- Other developers looking for help with current projects

### As a Visitor

- To easily understand what the page is about.
- To straight away visually see what the developer is capable of.
- To be able to navigate my way through the website and easily return to previously visited pages without using the back key.
- To be able to see and download the developers CV without leaving the site.
- To be able to view the developers projects to date.
- To be able to contact the developer and give as much information as needed.

The Website will consist of 4 pages and a link to the developers CV.

The wireframes can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/SYpJ97bFEnBfiS0DF3i0Rj/Portfolio)

## Testing

### Code Validator

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

No Issues detected.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)



Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
